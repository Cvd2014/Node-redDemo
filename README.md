My Demo for the Fast Start Madrid Conf

Data is sent to the dashboard via Watson IOT connectors. These are then printed to a dashboard and the most recent values are displayed on screen
Future improvements will involve adding in BP / blood sugar etc as well as a means to store the some of the data in a database to enable Watson Analytics
Additions will also involve addition of Watson Discovery to apply first aid knowledge to the information 
Image recognotion can add value by analysing ECG rythms
